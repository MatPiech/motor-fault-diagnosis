The Squirrel Cage Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis Dataset is a multi-sensor data collection gathered to expand research on anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and predictive maintenance, mainly using non-invasive methods such as thermal observation or vibration measurement. The measurements were gathered using advanced laboratory at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, designed to simulate and study motor defects.

  abstract="Equipment condition monitoring is essential to maintain the reliability of the electromechanical systems. Recently topics related to fault diagnosis have attracted significant interest, rapidly evolving this research area. This study presents a non-invasive method for online state classification of a squirrel-cage induction motor. The solution utilizes thermal imaging for non-contact analysis of thermal changes in machinery. Moreover, used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) streamline extracting relevant features from data and malfunction distinction without defining strict rules. A wide range of neural networks was evaluated to explore the possibilities of the proposed approach and their outputs were verified using model interpretability methods. Besides, the top-performing architectures were optimized and deployed on resource-constrained hardware to examine the system's performance in operating conditions. Overall, the completed tests have confirmed that the proposed approach is feasible, provides accurate results, and successfully operates even when deployed on edge devices.",

### Data and structure
The Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis dataset consists of several, simultaneously collected signals, such as:

The dataset separates the use of different clutches and within them, experiments are split into 3 classes, according to the below description:
- `misalignment-X-*` - where `X` means a series of experiments with the same shift
- `rotor-X-*` - where `X` means the number of broken cages in the squirrel-cage rotor
- the other contains samples gathered during proper motor operation

All examinations were conducted with and without current load - in the range 0 - 6 A (`*-current-load-X`).
